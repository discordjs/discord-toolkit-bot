# Privacy Policy

This Discord application does not read passing messages you send, unless you provide it as an argument to one of its commands or use a command on a specific message to parse its content. Adding the `bot` scope to your server does not yield any benefit. Functionality that utilizes gateway events apart from interaction creation (to respond to application commands) is limited to the discord.js support server.

This application does not persist data or make it available to third parties, including the developer (save temporary status and debug logs).
